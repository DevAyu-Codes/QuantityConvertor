Details (About Code):
* The code looks long only because of the conersion function.
* I tried my best to keep it as short as possible.
* If you need any help regarding the code, contact me on [WhatsApp](https://wa.link/wsov41)
	
Issues (as of v0.2):
* Some conversions might be incorrect (I've just used the formulae which I got from google and other websites)
* Conversion units are less (I'll add more in next version).
* ~~Code contain some warnings (simply ignore them).~~ (Fixed)
* Code may take time to compile as its long.

--> You can download the .jar file from release section and import it in Eclipse or IntelliJ IDE.
